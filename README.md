# SOLID Principles assignment using Java

The SOLID principles are a set of design principles in software development that aim to improve code maintainability and flexibility. They include the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), which focuses on ensuring that a class has only one responsibility, and the Open-Closed Principle (OCP), which promotes code extension without modification. The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) emphasizes substitutability between superclass and subclass objects. Applying these principles helps create more cohesive and adaptable software systems.
